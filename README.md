"Legba Notes - Collaborative note taking tool"

The Vision: Legba Notes is a collaborative note taking tool designed for students to help them in consolidating sources of information within their degree programme.
It displays resources such as videos and PDFs while simultaneously offering the ability to take notes, draw diagrams, add audio recordings, embed videos
and access forums for communicating with both other students and lecturers.
Eliminating the need for multiple file types to be saved separately, Legba Notes allows for all these components to be saved within a single file.

The ability to share files, collaborating on the note taking process, and the open format forums allow for easy, clear communication and means 
lecturers only need answer common questions once.
